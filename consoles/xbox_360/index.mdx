This is the "Pro" model from the launch line-up, which featured a 20GB hard drive, wireless controller and a silver DVD bezel. The production date of this unit is 2005-11-05, making it a very early unit. Of note is the gray on the hard drive at the top, which is very shiny and silvery. This was changed to a matte gray in later models."
