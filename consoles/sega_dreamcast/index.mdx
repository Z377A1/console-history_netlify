hero_image_alt: "The Sega Dreamcast, a video game console released on September 9th, 1999 in North America. The last console by Sega, the Dreamcast was well received at launch but many factors like Sega's financial troubles and the extreme popularity of Sony's PlayStation 2 led to the system being discontinued in early 2001. After dropping out of manufacturing hardware, Sega focused on publishing and developing software for other gaming platforms."
