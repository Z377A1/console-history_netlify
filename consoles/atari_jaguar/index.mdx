hero_image_alt: "The Atari Jaguar console shown with the standard controller. The Jaguar was a fifth generation gaming console released by Atari Corp. in 1993. Using a 3 chip, 5 processor design, it had a powerful (for its time) architecture, but games generally didn't fully utilize it due to the difficult nature of programming for it. It had a small game library with titles mostly published by Atari, a company that was had constant difficulties getting back in the dedicated gaming market after the Atari 2600. It was Atari's Corps last gaming console, as it took itself out of the gaming market after the huge failure of the console."
