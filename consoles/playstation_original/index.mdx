hero_image_alt: "A Sony PlayStation video game console, shown with controller and memory card attached. This is a Japanese SCPH-1000, which was the very first model of PlayStation commercially released. It is similar to the American SCPH-1001 except it also features an S-Video out and comes bundled with the shown SCPH-1010 controller. The SCPH-1010 was a short-lived controller model and was only bundled with the SCPH-1000. It features shorter arms, a shorter cord and lacks a ferrite bead compared to the more common SCPH-1080."
