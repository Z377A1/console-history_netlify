The Xbox was Microsoft's first foray into the gaming console market, and was followed by the Xbox 360 in 2005. The console is shown here with the Duke controller, the original pack-in controller, which was later replaced by a smaller 'S' controller. The console is notable for having a built-in hard drive, breakaway controller dongles and an Ethernet port to support Microsoft's online gaming service, Xbox Live."
